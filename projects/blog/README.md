# Blog Project

This is a full stack blog application which has similar features to [Medium](https://medium.com/) or [Dev.to](https://dev.to/). This is overall a well rounded project and a good option to choose if you are looking to explore web development more in depth, or if you are learning a new language or framework and want to explore its features.

For this project we assume you will be creating a separate front end and back end project, each with a different technology or framework. A common stack for this project is the [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) but any stack can be used.

## Backend (API)

### User stories

### API Routes

### ERD
